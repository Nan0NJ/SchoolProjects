            <p>
                The objective of MineSweeper is to clear all the mines from the game board without detonating any of them. The game board consists of a grid of cells, each of which can either contain a mine or be safe. Your goal is to identify the locations of the mines and mark them with a flag, while clearing the safe cells. <br> To begin playing, click on a cell on the game board. If the cell is safe, a number will appear, indicating how many mines are adjacent to that cell. If the cell contains a mine, the game is over. You can mark a cell as containing a mine by right-clicking on it, which will place a flag. The objective is to mark all the cells that contain mines and clear all the safe cells without detonating any mines.</p>

                Your score in Minesweeper is based on the time taken to complete a level, the number of mines cleared, and the number of flags used. The faster you complete a level with fewer flags used, the higher your score will be. You can also earn bonus points by completing levels without detonating any mines.</p>
